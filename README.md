Rhythmbox "Now Playing" Sidebar Plugin

##Description

Winamp style "Now Playing" sidebar: a sidebar placed on the right sidepane of Rhythmbox that contains a list with the currently playing song selection. 

Items are added to the Now Playing sidebar automatically when the user starts playback. Whenever playback starts, Now Playing memorizes the song selection and plays it until playback stops or the user chooses another song selection to play. This allows the user to explore the music library without Rhythmbox automatically changing the playing song selection (something I always found really annoying).
