# Rhythmbox "Now Playing" Sidebar Plugin

Winamp-style "Now Playing" sidebar: a sidebar placed on the right sidepane of Rhythmbox showing a list with the currently playing song selection.

## Main Features

- Items are added to the sidebar automatically when playback starts.
- Now Playing memorizes the current song selection and plays it until playback stops or the user chooses another selection. This allows the user to explore the music library without Rhythmbox automatically changing the playing selection.
- New menu actions allow users to add songs from the library to the currently playing selection. ![(Screenshot here.)](http://i.imgur.com/Oh3kZzR.png)
- The sidebar also includes a context menu with useful options (e.g., removing items by different criteria). ![(Screenshot here.)](http://i.imgur.com/kPiCC9F.png)
