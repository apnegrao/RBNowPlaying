Rhythmbox "Now Playing" Sidebar Plugin

##Description

Winamp style "Now Playing" sidebar: a sidebar placed on the right sidepane of Rhythmbox that contains the list of the currently playing song selection. Items are added to the sidebar automatically when the user starts playback by clicking on a source (the Library, PlayQueue or any playlist). Songs can also be added manually to the sidebar. Items are not removed from the playlist after playing.

When the songs are selected from the Library, the Now Playing sidebar memorizes the original selection. If the user later makes a new search in the Library (which would make Rhythmbox start playing a different selection), the original selection continues to play.
